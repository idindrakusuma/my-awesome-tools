## Text Editor

For text editors, I use ** Visual Studio Code ** or ** vscode **. Here are some reasons why I use visual studio code.

- Free and open source!
- There are lots of Plugins that are always being updated
- There are many themes Available!

Download disini: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
Link Github: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode

## Plugins

I focus on web-based programming. Here are some cool _plugins_ that I usually use.

### Live Server

Ever made static templates only html and css? usually so that the path can be placed in the `htdocs` apache folder right? Now plugins ** Live Server ** is used to run the html and css files through the project folder by creating a new local server. By default it will create a server on `localhost: 5050`.

Install plugins:
```
ext install ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

### Material Icon Theme

Bored with the icon of the vscode project folder? try it ** Material Icon Theme ** so that your file icon and folder become more colorful and nice!

Install plugins:
```
ext install PKief.material-icon-theme
```

### Material Color Theme

The previous one changes the icon to make it more interesting, now this will makes your editor more interesting and comfortable during the coding process. There are several themes that can be selected starting from the dark to the high. I really recommend it.

Install plugins:
```
ext install Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme
```

### GitLens

The role of git in the development process software is like rice with side dishes! it's really important to be more enjoyable :D If you use this GitLens plugins, the project versioning process becomes even easier and much more productive. My favorite feature is, the popup feature. It provides information about who commits? Which logs? When?

Install plugins:
```
ext install eamodio.gitlens
```

### Code Snippets

In this modern and fast-paced era, various snippets for certain programming languages ​​are needed so that the coding process becomes faster and more efficient. So it's perfect for you to install code snippets in the text editor. Here are some spippets that I use

- ES7 React / Redux / GraphQL / React-Native => for user react => `ext install dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets`
- Vetur => for VueJS user => `ext install octref.vetur`
- Javascript (ES6) Code Snippets => for JS users => `ext install xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets`

And so on, you can find yourself in the market place according to the programming language used.

### Language Support

Language Support is almost similar to Code Snippets, usually one package. So some languages that are recently like `stylus`,` go`, `solidity` are not supported by default, they need to be installed by themselves so that snippets and syntax highlighting can appear in the text editor.

### Keybindings

If I used to use PHPStrorm and WebStorm and get used to the shortcuts on the product jet brains. Now, instead of learning more about the shortcuts in vscode, I just install the keybindings. So vscode feels like PHPStorm or WebStorm: D

Install plugins: 
```
ext install k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings
```

## Font

For me, the selection of fonts in the code is very important, especially those who can support various things such as arrows and special characters. So that the fonts are cool, I recommend using Fira Code.

## Browser

I recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition. Because both browsers have Dev Tools that are very complete. Good debugging and so on.

- Google Chrome => https://www.google.com/chrome/
- Quantum Developer Edition Firefox => https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/

## Browser Extension

For browser extensions, I use some cool tools including:

1. Wappalyzer => for what stack analysis is used by the opened website. => https://www.wappalyzer.com/
2. JSON Viewer => to view JSON data formatted via browser => https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh

5. Vue Devtools => vue programmers must have! => https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd
6. Google Translate => can translate directly when selecting text in the browser (don't have to open translate.google.com) => https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb
